Attached is a file containing data about a company's payments over a 1 year period. The file is in CSV format, and each row after the first contains data about an individual transaction.

These are the column headers, and an example row of data:

Column Headers: Transaction ID, Financial Institution, Payment Type, Amount, Currency, Vendor, Tags, Date
Example Rows:   19385281, "Wells Fargo", "Debit Card", "1.07", "USD", "STARBUCKS, INC.", "personal food", "2008-09-15Z15:53:00" 


Use the data to answer these questions:

1. How much was spent on the Wells Fargo Debit Card?

2. How many unique vendors did the company transact with?

3. The company is worried too much money is being spent on perks for employees. How much is being spent on items tagged either "personal" or "food"?

4. The company had a party in London the weekend of January 23-25, 2012. How much did they spend over that period? Tip: The time zone during this period is equivalent to UTC.

5. On how many evenings in December did the company buy from at least two distinct bars? Only count purchases made in December between 6:00 PM to 12:00 AM Pacific Time. The names of the bars are: "RICKHOUSE", "P.C.H.", "BLOODHOUND", "IRISH BANK".

6. Search the data for "suspicious spends" for each vendor. Suspicious spends are defined as more than 1.75 standard deviations above the mean of purchases for a given vendor. Print the vendor names and transaction IDs.


Details about the data: Each Transaction ID is unique to a given financial institution. Tags are separated by spaces. The date is in ISO 8601 format, and all dates are UTC.
